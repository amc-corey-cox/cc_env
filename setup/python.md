If possible I want to stay with the base Python on my system and upgrade as necessary. However it may be necessary to downgrade for compatibility at times. If I have to do so, I will document the specifics here.

In addition, Python development often requires a fair number of libraries for quick development. Here I document the ones I have found I need for current development and any changes or difficulties on installation.

Python Modules:
  tarfile
  pandas
  yaml
  grape
