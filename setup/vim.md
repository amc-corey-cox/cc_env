# VIM and NeoVIM
Despite using several IDE's for development I still find myself hopping into files regularly at the command line and I like to use VIM for that. I'm also trying out NeoVIM because I've heard good things and it seems really similar to VIM with some added features.
Ubuntu ships with a tiny verison of VIM available with vi. This seems serviceable enough but I want the full-featured VIM so we'll install it.

# Git Installation
To install VIM and NeoVIM
```
sudo apt install vim
sudo apt install neovim
```
I don't currently have any plugins or additional packages that I need to install but I should try to remember to add them here if I decide to add any.

## VIM Config
Currently, my VIM config is rather simple and can be created with the commands below.
```
cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
I keep meaning to improve upon this .vimrc but I don't seem to get to it. As I do, I'll capture improvements here.
