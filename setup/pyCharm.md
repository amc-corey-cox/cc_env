# pyCharm - IDE for Python
Previously, I had installed by downloading the tarbal and unpacking to /opt. However, I just noticed there is now a version available through App Center. I'm going to try installing that way this time and see how it goes.
I'll make notes here if I have any trouble.

## Install via Tarball
This is the past information on installing via tarball. It looks like it should still work but I will be using the above method for now.

Install by unpacking to /opt

```
sudo tar xzf pycharm-*.tar.gz -C /opt/pyCharm
```

add opt/pyCharm/bin to PATH in .profile
